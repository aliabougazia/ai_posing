# Python Requirements for AI Pose Generator Blender Add-on

## Required (for basic functionality)
# These are typically included with Blender's Python
numpy>=1.20.0

## Optional (for enhanced functionality)
# Install these in Blender's Python for better image processing
opencv-python>=4.5.0

## Development Dependencies (not needed for add-on usage)
# Only needed if you're developing/testing the add-on
pytest>=7.0.0
black>=22.0.0
pylint>=2.12.0

## Notes:
# - Blender includes its own Python environment
# - To install packages in Blender's Python:
#   1. Find Blender's Python executable
